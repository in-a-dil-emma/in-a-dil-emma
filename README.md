<pre>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to draw manga
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything Nix/NixOS
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with [everything]
- 💬 Ask me about anything, really; nothing's off limits (assuming it doesn't cross legal and personal boundaries)
- 📫 How to reach me: email
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them peferred over she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like DnB, EDM and Breakcore. I overshare too much.
- 🚑 I have a very strange sense of humor.

<small><i>My philosophy? Chaos.</i></small>

My code is certified ADHD ware.

<small>(That sounded better in my head; It means I have ADHD and write lots of ((bad)) code while in a hyperfocus...)</small>

<small>(That _also_ implies most code I write was written while in a hyperfocus.)</small>

<small>(which also implies I write only bad code, but don't tell anyone shhhhhhh)</small>

_You know, instead of blurting out unhinged stuff, maybe I could finally put my blog to use?_
