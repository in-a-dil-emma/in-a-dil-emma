&lt;!-- Here are some ideas to get you started: --&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;

- I’m currently working on things related to Nix and NixOS (my config, public modules, PRs)
- I’m currently learning how to draw manga
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything Nix/NixOS
- I’m looking for help with [everything]
- Ask me about anything, really; nothing's off limits (assuming it doesn't cross legal and personal boundaries)
- How to reach me: email
- Pronouns: they/them peferred over she/her
- Fun fact: I like DnB, EDM and Breakcore. I overshare too much.
- I have a very strange sense of humor.

&lt;/pre&gt;
